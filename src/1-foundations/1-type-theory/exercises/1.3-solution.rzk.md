## Problem statement

Derive the induction principle for products $ind_{A \times B}$, using only the projections and
the propositional uniqueness principle $uniq_{A \times B}$. Verify that the definitional equalities are valid.
Generalize $uniq_{A \times B}$ to $\Sigma$-types, and do the same for $\Sigma$-types. (This requires concepts from Chapter 2.)

## Solution
