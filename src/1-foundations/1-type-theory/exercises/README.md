# Exercises for Section 1

## Exercise 1.1

Given functions $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$,
define their composite $g \circ f : A \to C$.
Show that we have $h \circ (g \circ f) \equiv (h \circ g) \circ f$.

## Exercise 1.2

Derive the recursion principle for products
$rec_{A \times B}$ using only the projections,
and verify that the definitional equalities are valid.
Do the same for $\Sigma$-types.

## Exercise 1.3

Derive the induction principle for products $ind_{A \times B}$, using only the projections and
the propositional uniqueness principle $uniq_{A \times B}$. Verify that the definitional equalities are valid.
Generalize $uniq_{A \times B}$ to $\Sigma$-types, and do the same for $\Sigma$-types. (This requires concepts from Chapter 2.)
