## Problem statement

Show that the three obvious proofs of Lemma 2.1.2 are pairwise equal.

Lemma 2.1.2: (note we use $\circ$ instead of square dot due to technical limitations)

For every type $A$ and every $x, y, z : A$ there is a function

$$
(x = y) \rightarrow (y = z) \rightarrow (x = z),
$$

written
$p \mapsto q \mapsto p \circ q$, such that $\text{refl}_x \circ \text{refl}_x \equiv \text{refl}_x$ for any $x : A$. We call $p \circ q$ the concatenation or
composite of $p$ and $q$.
